/** HeadersSyncState:
 *
 * We wish to download a peer's headers chain in a DoS-resistant way.
 *
 * The Bitcoin protocol does not offer an easy way to determine the work on a
 * peer's chain. Currently, we can query a peer's headers by using a GETHEADERS
 * message, and our peer can return a set of up to 2000 headers that connect to
 * something we know. If a peer's chain has more than 2000 blocks, then we need
 * a way to verify that the chain actually has enough work on it to be useful to
 * us -- by being above our anti-DoS minimum-chain-work threshold -- before we
 * commit to storing those headers in memory. Otherwise, it would be cheap for
 * an attacker to waste all our memory by serving us low-work headers
 * (particularly for a new node coming online for the first time).
 *
 * To prevent memory-DoS with low-work headers, while still always being
 * able to reorg to whatever the most-work chain is, we require that a chain
 * meet a work threshold before committing it to memory. We can do this by
 * downloading a peer's headers twice, whenever we are not sure that the chain
 * has sufficient work:
 *
 * - In the first download phase, we can calculate the work on the chain as we
 * go (just by checking the nBits value on each header, and validating the
 * proof-of-work).
 *
 * - Once we have reached a header where the cumulative chain work is
 * sufficient, we switch to downloading the headers a second time, this time
 * storing them in memory.
 *
 * To prevent an attacker from using (eg) the honest chain to convince us that
 * they have a high-work chain, but then feeding us an alternate set of
 * low-difficulty headers in the second phase, we store commitments to the
 * chain we see in the first download phase that we check in the second phase,
 * as follows:
 *
 * - In phase 1, store 1 bit (using a salted hash function) for every N headers
 * that we see. With a reasonable choice of N, this uses relatively little
 * memory even for a very long chain.
 *
 * - In phase 2 (redownload), keep a lookahead buffer of size H, and only
 * accept a batch of N (N < H) headers to memory once we've verified that H/N =
 * S commitments have all passed verification. With this parametrization, we
 * can achieve a given security target (S) while choosing H and N to minimize
 * memory usage in this scheme.
