 * 3. A v3's ancestor set, including itself, must be within V3_ANCESTOR_LIMIT.
 * 4. A v3's descendant set, including itself, must be within V3_DESCENDANT_LIMIT.
 * 5. If a v3 tx has any unconfirmed ancestors, the tx's sigop-adjusted vsize must be within

 * @param[in]   mempool_ancestors       The in-mempool ancestors of ptx, including any that are only
 *                                      direct ancestors of its in-package ancestors.
 * @param[in]   direct_conflicts        In-mempool transactions this tx conflicts with. These conflicts
 *                                      are used to more accurately calculate the resulting descendant
 *                                      count of in-mempool ancestors.  While V3_ANCESTOR_LIMIT is 2, it

 *                                      because the presence of both in-mempool and in-package ancestors
 *                                      would already be a violation of V3_ANCESTOR_LIMIT.
 * @param[in]   vsize                   The sigop-adjusted virtual size of ptx.
 * @returns an error string if any v3 rule was violated, otherwise std::nullopt.
